Description
===========
This repository contains electronic supporting information for the
paper submitted by A. Landi and D. Padula.

In this folder there are:

- Gas phase QM (B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d)) and MM (QMD-FF) optimised geometries (see
`gp` folder)

- QM (B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d)) optimised geometries including solvent effects (see
`PCM` folder)

- archives (`ZR1_IDIC-4Cl.tgz` and `ZR1_Y6.tgz`)
containing xyz geometries of snapshots extracted from the trajectories for the
two D/A pairs. Geometries are names as follows:

`DonorName_DonorResid_AccptName_AccptResid_Time.xyz`

On each pair we computed excitonic couplings and transfer integrals as described
in the paper.
