Description
===========
This repository contains electronic supporting information for the
paper submitted by A. Landi and D. Padula.

In this folder there are gromacs topologies ready to run simulations for the
three molecules studied, as obtained with the Joyce protocol.
Atomic charges are derived from the RESP procedure, while non-bonded parameters
are taken from corresponding OPLS atom types, as specified in the comments.
